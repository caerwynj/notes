Bug in flushmemscreen. Resize of window in JIT mode.

THe scheduling is slightly different in JIT mode versus interpreted.
We might be trigering a race condition so that we are attempting
to XSync or free memory when some other operation is going on, 
such as an xexpose due to a mouse event.  Mouse events are happening
when we redraw a screen at the same time we are drawing the screen.

Lots of other window functions apparently work.
wm/sh, wm/task, wm/memory, wm/clock. 
Moving windows.
It's only when we resize.
